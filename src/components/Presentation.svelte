    Hey, I'm James, 28, a certified wellness and intimacy coach based in Paris.

    I created this space because I believe everyone deserves to explore their sexuality and experience genuine connections in a safe, judgment-free environment. Through my background in psychology and personal development, I help people rediscover themselves and break free from loneliness.

    My approach is unique - I focus on creating authentic connections first. Whether you're exploring your sexuality, wanting to build confidence, or simply seeking human connection, I provide a comfortable space where you can be yourself completely. No judgments, no expectations - just genuine understanding and guidance.

    I specialize in helping people:
    • Explore their sexuality safely and confidently
    • Build genuine connections and fight loneliness
    • Discover their desires and boundaries
    • Practice intimacy without relationship pressure
    • Experience tender moments and simple pleasures
    • Gain confidence in their body and sexuality

    Your privacy and comfort are my absolute priorities. Every session starts with conversation to ensure we're aligned and you feel completely at ease. I'm here to listen, guide, and help you explore at your own pace.

    Fluent in English and French, I adapt to your needs while maintaining absolute discretion.
