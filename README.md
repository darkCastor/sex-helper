 Page Structure:
 ```html
 <Layout>
   <!-- Hero Section with Main CTA -->

   <!-- Core Arguments (3 main ones) -->

   <!-- Social Proof / Testimonials -->

   <!-- Trust Indicators -->

   <!-- Experience Benefits -->

   <!-- Features Grid (smaller cards) -->

   <!-- FAQ Section -->

   <!-- Final CTA -->

   <!-- Footer -->
 </Layout>
 ```

 This structure:
 - Maintains focus on core benefits
 - Provides additional information progressively
 - Creates better visual hierarchy
 - Keeps user engagement through the page
 - Addresses different user concerns at appropriate points
 - Builds trust progressively
 - Ends with clear call-to-action

- this application won't be for a team finally but only for one person which is me because it's too difficult to find good people for that project.
- what about make a about page for me ?
